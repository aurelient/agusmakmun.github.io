<h2>Pages to look at before this one</h2>

<p>
  Getting started working in our lab (especially for master students), follow <a href="http://romain.vuillemot.net/students/getstarted/">Romain Vuillemot's instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When it comes to attitude and organization, also check <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/msb/gettingstarted/">Michael Berstein's Getting Started Page</a>
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shengdongzhao.com/research-tips/">Shengdong Zhao's page</a> is full of useful ressources and tips</p>


<p>
  On research and phd advice, Smitha Milli set up a <a href="https://github.com/smilli/research-advice">good list of resources</a>
  but mostly targeted at north americans.
  <a href="http://www.itu.dk/people/bardram/pmwiki/?n=Main.ArtPhD">Jakob Bardram's Art of doing a Ph.D.</a>
  has advice better suited to European 3 years long phds.
  Also, have a look at <a href="http://pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir.htm">Philip Guo's Ph.D. Grind</a>
  (or <a href="http://www.synapticlee.co.uk/collected-advice/">here</a>
  and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/">here</a> for even more tips).

  <h3 id="poster">Posters</h3>
  <div class="projectdescription">
    <p class="subtitle"></p>

    <p>
      There are two competing goals when designing a conference poster: 1. Getting people to come check it out and talk to you (this is the main one); 2. Make people curious about your work, when you're not in front of the poster, either so that they come back later, or that they check stuff online. <em>It is not a mini-paper</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Patrick Baudisch set up a <a href="http://www.acm.org/uist/posterexamplegallery/">web page</a> on posters for UIST, it is relevant for any other conference. He wisely suggests to let <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+make+conference+poster">Google give you some more tips</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Collin Purrington has a nice article on <a href="http://colinpurrington.com/tips/academic/posterdesign">designing conference posters</a>.
      He also manages the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/postersessions/">Poster Sessions</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/pimpmyposter/">Pimp my poster</a> Flickr groups.
    </p>

    <h5>On design:</h5>
    <p>This is an endless topic, but here are some universal tips that would work for any non designer:
      <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/17/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design/">lessons from swiss style graphic design</a> by Smashing Magazine.

    </p>

    <h5>Tools of the trade:</h5>
    <p>
      You should use a tool that lets you organize information and <em>print it</em> nicely. So using a software made for detailed page layout, text flowing around images and handling of high-res pictures is best. I'm currently using Figma or Keynote.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you have the Adobe Suite, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">InDesign</a> is best. <a href="http://www.scribus.net">Scribus</a> is a good Free Software alternative, LaTex is always here to help if you find a nice template.</li>
        <li>You can also use a Vector Graphics tool like <a href="http://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, Illustrator or <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</li>
        <li>On Macs, Omnigraffle does a great job and is much easier to learn; Pages comes with some very basic poster templates. Power Point is widely used often for the worst, it is really worth your time learning Scribus or Inkscape. On Linux go for Scribus, Latex or Inkscape.</li>
      </ul>

<h2>Evaluation Methods</h2>

  <h3>Quasi-Experiments</h3>
  <div class="projectdescription">
    <p class="subtitle">I tend to favor those over over lab exp.</p>
    <p>
      Check out <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/methods/readings/Shadish.pdf">Shadish, Cook and Campbell book on Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference (pdf, consider buying the book if you find it useful)</a>.
    </p>
  </div>


  <h3>Controlled lab experiments</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Scott MacKenzie set up some useful pages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mack/RN-FittsIndependentVariables.html">On dependant and independant variables</a> (in Fitts's Law...)</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mack/RN-Anova.html">Anova explained</a> (Analysis of Variance) + <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mack/Anova2.html">some Java tool to do the Analysis.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mack/RN-Counterbalancing.html">On within and between subjects experiments + counterbalancing.	</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>Stats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://plot.ly/">Plot.ly</a> is pretty good for early visual / statistical analysis before jumping into R.</li>
    <li><a href="http://yatani.jp/teaching/doku.php?id=hcistats:start#ExperimentalDesign">Koji Yatani's Statistical Methods for HCI Research</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://littlestat.com/">LittleStat</a>(alpha) is a great tool to calculate statistics online. It also helps to pick the right statistical tool for your analysis through a simple series of yes/no answers.</li>
  </ul>
