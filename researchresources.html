  On research and phd advice, Smitha Milli set up a <a href="https://github.com/smilli/research-advice">good list of resources</a>
  but mostly targeted at north americans.
  <a href="http://www.itu.dk/people/bardram/pmwiki/?n=Main.ArtPhD">Jakob Bardram's Art of doing a Ph.D.</a>
  has advice better suited to European 3 years long phds.

    <h5>Tools of the trade:</h5>
    <p>
      The aim of a poster is to convey information clearly in a printed format. The best way to get there is to use software that lets you organize information and print it nicely. So using a software made for detailed page layout, text flowing around images and handling of high-res pictures is best.
      <ul>
        <li>If you have the Adobe Suite, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">InDesign</a> is best. <a href="http://www.scribus.net">Scribus</a> is a good Free Software alternative, LaTex is always here to help if you find a nice template.</li>
        <li>You can also use a Vector Graphics tool like Illustrator or <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>.</li>
        <li>On Macs, Omnigraffle does a great job and is much easier to learn; Pages comes with some very basic poster templates. On Windows, Power Point is widely used often for worst, it is really worth your time learning Scribus or Inkscape. On Linux go for Scribus, Latex or Inkscape.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h3>Stats</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://plot.ly/">Plot.ly</a> is pretty good for early visual / statistical analysis before jumping into R.</li>
    <li><a href="http://yatani.jp/teaching/doku.php?id=hcistats:start#ExperimentalDesign">Koji Yatani's Statistical Methods for HCI Research</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://littlestat.com/">LittleStat</a>(alpha) is a great tool to calculate statistics online. It also helps to pick the right statistical tool for your analysis through a simple series of yes/no answers.</li>
